Typescript basics:
	installed typescript:
		npm install -g typescript
	installed ts node:
		npm install -g ts-node
	create config file for typescript (done in cmd prompt for admin access) ('tsc' is typescript compiler):
		tsc --init
	create js file from ts file (done in cmd prompt for admin access) :
		tsc fileName.ts
	run js file:
		node fileName.js
	install 'Code Runner' extension (to run ts more efficiently than creating js files first):
		then right click on ts file > 'run code' 

Playwright:
	install playwright:
		npm init playwright@latest (then keep defaults)
	run default test(s):
		npx playwright test
	run tests with x paralell workers:
		npx playwright test --workers x
	run a test from specific spec file:
		npx playwright test [relative path to spec file (with forward slashes!)]
	run multiple spec files: - NOTE: '.spec.ts' not needed to run file, just first name works
		npx playwright test [name of 1st spec file] [name of 2nd spec file]
	run a test by it's test name:
		npx playwright test -g 'test name'
	run tests only in chromium:
		npx playwright test --project=chromium
	run tests as headless
		npx playwright test --headed
	run tests in debug mode for a browser:
		npx playwright test --project=chromium --debug
	enable automatic code generation:
		npx playwright codegen
