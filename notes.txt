handy links:
	good testing site:
		https://www.saucedemo.com/
	chrome locators plugins (when inspecting element, the plugins tabs give unique locator info):
		SelectorsHub
		LetXPath


Typescript basics:
	installed typescript:
		npm install -g typescript
	installed ts node:
		npm install -g ts-node
	create config file for typescript (done in cmd prompt for admin access) ('tsc' is typescript compiler):
		tsc --init
	create js file from ts file (done in cmd prompt for admin access) :
		tsc fileName.ts
	run js file:
		node fileName.js
	install 'Code Runner' extension (to run ts more efficiently than creating js files first):
		then right click on ts file > 'run code' 

Playwright:
	install playwright:
		npm init playwright@latest (then keep defaults)
	run default test(s):
		npx playwright test
	run tests with x paralell workers:
		npx playwright test --workers x
	run a test from specific spec file:
		npx playwright test [relative path to spec file (with forward slashes!)]
	run multiple spec files: - NOTE: '.spec.ts' not needed to run file, just first name works
		npx playwright test [name of 1st spec file] [name of 2nd spec file]
	run a test by it's test name:
		npx playwright test -g 'test name'
	run tests only in chromium:
		npx playwright test --project=chromium
	run tests as headed:
		npx playwright test --headed
	run tests in debug mode for a browser:
		npx playwright test --project=chromium --debug

codegen:
	enable automatic code generation:
		npx playwright codegen
	ebable with specific browser (chromium is default):
		npx playwright codegen --browser firefox
	automatically output a file with actions listed (instead of having to paste from window and create by default):
		npx playwright codegen -o ./tests/nameOfNewFile.spec.ts
	ebable with a specific viewport size:
		npx playwright codegen --viewport-size=800,600
	enable with a specific device size:
		npx playwright codegen --device="iPhone 11 Pro"
	show codegen help options:
		npx playwright codegen --help

traceviewer (found under 'retry' tab in test report):
	open created trace.zip:
		npx playwright show-trace ./[copied relative path, with back slashes changed to frwrd slashes]
	got to trace website, and upload trace.zip file:
		trace.playwright.dev
	change trace command (from whats defined in config file) on test run:
		npx playwright test --trace=[command you want. eg: on]

Locating element in webpage dom:
	find with id: #
	find with css: [put in squarebrackets]
	x path: //nameOfTag[@attributeName=attributeValue] 
	find locator using playwright toolkit:
		add: await page.pause(); to test. toolkit will open with pause > locator tab > select element to see locator name
